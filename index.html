            <li><strong>Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die.</strong>In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can come and take our place.</li>
            <li><strong>Our life here is truly hellish.</strong>Fortunately, my soldiers are very brave and tougher than the enemy.</li>
            <li><strong>There is no defense line, but defense territory. This territory is the whole of the motherland!</strong></li>
            <li>Our object now is to strengthen the ties that bind us to other nations. There may be a great many countries in the world, but there is only one civilization, and if a nation is to achieve progress, she must be a part of this civilization. The Ottoman Empire began to decline the day when, proud of her success against the West, she cut the ties that bound her to the European nations.</li>
            <li><strong>The heroes who shed their blood and lost their lives on this country's soil! You are in the soil of a friendly country now. Therefore rest in peace.</strong>You are side by side with the little Mehmets. The mothers who send their sons to the war! Wipe your tears away. Your sons are in our bosom, are in peace and will be sleeping in peace comfortably. From now on, they have became our sons since they have lost their lives on this land.</li>
            <li><strong>I have no religion, and at times I wish all religions at the bottom of the sea.</strong>He is a weak ruler who needs religion to uphold his government; it is as if he would catch his people in a trap.<stron>My people are going to learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science.</stron>Superstition must go. Let them worship as they will; every man can follow his own conscience, provided it does not interfere with sane reason or bid him against the liberty of his fellow-men.</li>
            <li>We do not consider our principles as dogmas contained in books that are said to come from heaven. We derive our inspiration, not from heaven, or from an unseen world, but directly from life.</li>
            <li><strong>Lasting peace is sought, it is essential to adopt international measures to improve the lot of the masses.</strong>The welfare of the entire human race must replace hunger and oppression. People of the world must be taught to give up envy, avarice and rancour.</li>
            <li>Even before accepting the religion of the Arabs, the Turks were a great nation. After accepting the religion of the Arabs, this religion, didn't effect to combine the Arabs, the Persians and Egyptians with the Turks to constitute a nation. (This religion) rather, loosened the national nexus of Turkish nation, got national excitement numb. This was very natural. Because the purpose of the religion founded by Muhammad, over all nations, was to drag to an including Arab national politics.</li>
            <li>The foundation of our religion is very strong. The material is strong as well, but the building itself was neglected for hundreds of years. As the plaster dropped down, none thought to replace it and none felt the need to reinforce the building. Quite the contrary: many foreign elements and interpretations, as well as empty beliefs, came along and damaged it still more.</li>
            <li><strong>The future is in the skies.</strong></li>
            <li>[Turkish women] had lived free of the veil for 5,000 years, and had been covered only in the last 600 years.</li>
            <li><strong>To write history is as important as to make history. If the writer does not remain true to the maker, then the unchanging truth takes on a quality that will confuse the humanity.</strong></li>
            <li>We did not win the war with prayers, but with the blood of our soldiers.</li>
        </ul>

                    Despite his radical secular reforms, Atatürk remained broadly popular in the <strong>Muslim world.</strong> He is remembered for being the creator of a new, fully independent Muslim country at a time of encroachment by Christian powers, and for having prevailed in a struggle against Western imperialism. When he died, the All-India Muslim League eulogised him as a <em>"truly great personality in the Islamic world, a great general and a great statesman"</em>, declaring that his memory would "inspire Muslims all over the world with courage, perseverance and manliness".
